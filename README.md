Overview
Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various fields, from finance and economics to weather prediction and resource management. 
This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast future values based on historical time series data.

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to build a robust forecasting model that can predict future values with high accuracy. 
By utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM networks known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, this project aims to provide valuable insights and predictions for time-dependent processes.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing:
Data Loading: Import and examine historical time series data.
Normalization: Scale the data to a range suitable for model training, ensuring better performance and stability.
Dataset Creation: Transform the time series data into sequences that the LSTM model can process.

Model Development:
LSTM Network Design: Construct a deep learning model using LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns in the data.
Regularization: Implement dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

Model Training:
Training Process: Fit the LSTM model on historical data, adjusting weights and biases to minimize forecasting error.
Validation: Evaluate the model's performance using a separate validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

Evaluation:
Performance Metrics: Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Plot training loss curves and compare predicted values with actual values to evaluate model performance.

Libraries and Tools:
Python: Programming language used for implementing the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing, including loading CSV files and handling time series data.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data, training loss, and predictions.
Scikit-learn: For data scaling (e.g., using MinMaxScaler) and model evaluation metrics.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model. TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library, and Keras is its high-level API used for model creation and training

Forecasting:
Future Predictions: Use the trained model to forecast future values, providing actionable insights based on historical patterns.
Outcome: This project aims to deliver a well-trained LSTM model capable of making accurate and reliable forecasts. 
It includes comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases, along with visualizations and metrics to assess performance.
The resulting model can be applied to various time series forecasting scenarios, offering valuable predictions and insights for decision-making.
